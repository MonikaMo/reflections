What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
It initiates a new empty repository. We need it so we can store our versions.


How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
The working directory is de dir that contains our project and the repository. The staging area is the middle lane between them, so we can make changes before commiting.
